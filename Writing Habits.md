## Writing Habits
- During Comp I generally wrote in advance; however, senioritis has set in and I find myself procrastinating more and more for different assignments.
- I like to write in chunks rather than all at once.
- Usually at night which causes me to want to go to bed.
- Sometimes I try to write just so it will make falling asleep easier. Most of the time I'll read it the next day and it makes no sense.

## Fixing Them
- Wake up earlier or work on it during a break throughout the day.
- Try to set a time every day specifically for writing.

## One strengh
- I do my best work when I get in "comp mode". I can knock a paper out and it'll sound pretty dang good too. You never know when it might hit.
