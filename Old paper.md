# Soybeans

Soybeans (glycine max), is a species of legume widely grown for its edible bean, which
has numerous uses. Originating in Southeast Asia, soybeans were first domesticated by Chinese
farmers around 1100 BC; by the first century AD, soybeans spread to Japan and many other
countries around the world. Cultivation of the crop is most successful in climates with hot
summers. Optimum growing conditions provide soil temperatures ranging from 68-86°F, if
lower, growth is significantly stunted. They can grow in a wide range of soils, with optimum
growth in moist alluvial soils with good organic matter content. In 1995, Monsanto Company
introduced glyphosate-tolerant soybeans. This variety of soybeans have been genetically
modified to be resistant to Monsanto's glyphosate herbicides through substitution of the
Agrobacterium sp. gene EPSP synthase. The substituted version is not sensitive to glyphosate.
In 1997, approximately 8% of all soybeans cultivated were genetically modified, by 2010, over
93% of the crop had been modified. This modification aids in better soil quality by requiring
less tillage before and after the plants lifecycle. Also, these soybeans required less pesticides. A
USDA report stated, “The overall estimated benefits of the adoption of GE soybeans in the
United States was $310 million”. The genetic modification of soybeans continues to save
farmers millions of dollars every year, which in turn allows them to spend their savings on more
seed to increase profits. According to USDA, the United States of America set a record high for
soybean production in 2017, producing 4.39 billion bushels, up 2% from the last year. The
average yield is estimated at 49.1 bushels per acre, which is 2.9 bushels down from last year;
however, harvested area is at a record 89.5 million acres, up 8% from 2016. The increase in
harvested area is what allowed farmers to set a record high production in 2017. The United
States leads worldwide soybean production with Brazil trailing shortly behind; Argentina is
third, being over 50% less than the United States.

I will be trading as a fundamentalist based on supply and demand. I believe important
variables are: planted area, harvested area, yield, beginning stocks, production, imports, crush,
exports, seed, residual, weather, value of the dollar, world production, government regulations,
cost of production, and transportation. Carryover was extremely high, having an 83.77%
increase from 17/18 to the projected 18/19. Exports were trailing far behind at 6.54%; however,
still significant due to the decrease of exports by 35 million bushels. The following chart displays
these variables and the current supply and demand of soybeans, it also includes percent change
between 17/18 and the projected 18/19.
