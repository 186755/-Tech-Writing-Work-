### This stuff is confusing

Normally I write in Microsoft Word because it is easy to work with.  I like using *Google* to get a wide range of information; then, I narrow down the results by selecting reputible sites.
I enjoy writing about my **cows** and experiences I have encountered with them.  My favorite breed is Milking Shorthorns [AMSS](www.milkingshorthorn.com).
