### This stuff is confusing

Normally I write in Microsoft Word because it is easy to work with.  I like using *Google* to get a wide range of information; then, I narrow down the results by selecting reputible sites.
I enjoy writing about my **cows** and experiences I have encountered with them.  My favorite breed is Milking Shorthorns; thier website offers many different facts about the breed and its history [AMSS](http://www.milkingshorthorn.com/).
#### A few of my cows names are listed below 
- Angel
- Rose
- Maddie
- Oakleigh
- Timber

> Until next time
